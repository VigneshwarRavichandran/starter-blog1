> I'm **_Vigneshwar Ravichandran_** an engineering student with lots of passion over developing especially **_Back-end Developing._** Always love to explore new languages and frameworks**_._** _Coding_ was not something I learnt to do or was chosen out of the options I had, it was something I was comfortable doing. A small story line of mine '_Years ago Developing was my crush, now its my love and soon its gona become my life partner_ '.

> Unlike many of my guys, I had some type of job description for my career. I don't believe in the quantity of employees in the company, always believe the quality in them.

> I need to thank someone - [Naveen Honest Raj](https://naveenhonestraj.in/). He is the one who moulded me into a good script. The _developer_ whom I admire the most.
>
> I believe in the concept that a _good logic builder_ can easily turn into a _great_ _programmer._ I have worked a lot on **_Python_** and its framework. I still can't forget the days which made me feel like _programming_ was not my cup of tea. It took some time to overcome than illusion.
