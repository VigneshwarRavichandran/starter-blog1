> I'm **Vigneshwar Ravichandran** an engineering student with lots of passion over developing especially **Back-end Developing.** Always love to explore new languages and frameworks. **Coding** was not something I learnt to do or was chosen out of the options I had, it was something I was comfortable doing. A small story line of mine '_Years ago Developing was my crush, now its my love and soon its gona become my life partner_ '.
>
> Unlike many, I had some type of job description for my career. I don't believe in the quantity of employees in the company, always believe the quality in them.
>
> I need to thank someone - [Naveen Honest Raj](https://naveenhonestraj.in/). He is the one who moulded me into a good script. The **Developer** whom I admire the most.
>
> I believe in the concept that a good logic builder can easily turn into a great programmer_._ I have worked a lot on **Python** and its framework. I still can't forget the days which made me feel like programming was not my cup of tea. It took some time to overcome than illusion.
